> ⚠️ This theme are not avilable on The Visual Studio Marketplace

I created this theme because I felt that the available theme's in the Visual Studio Code extension/marketplace were not suitable for me. This theme is not yet fully supported for all programming languages, so it is not yet perfect. However, if you want to try it out, you can follow the steps below

## How To Install

- Open your terminal
- Make sure you have npm installed allready
- Install `yo code`

```shell terminal
npm install -g yo generator-code
```

- Download or Clone this repository

```shell terminal
git clone https://github.com/sweetcuptea/apple-valley.git
```

- Go to the apple-valley directory

```shell terminal
cd apple-valley
```

- Once you are inside the directory folder, then install

```shell terminal
code --install-extension apple-valley-0.0.1.vsix
```

- Open your Visual Studio Code and you can check it in the extensions tab
- Set color theme
- Enjoy!
